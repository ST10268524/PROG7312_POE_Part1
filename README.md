# MunicipalServices

MunicipalServices is an ASP.NET Core MVC web application built in C#.  
It is designed to help municipalities streamline citizen engagement by allowing residents to **report issues and service requests**.  

The application is user-friendly and serves as the first step in a broader municipal service platform.
